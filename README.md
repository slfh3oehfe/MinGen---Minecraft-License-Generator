MinGen is a program that uses 2 highly volnurable exploits Gener7 and MCSploit.
Gener7 is a exploit found when generation the license key.
What the exploit does, is generate the key and send it to the server.
MCSploit is a custom exploit that uses Gener7 to control the key and export it.
The exploit Gener7 has been around for years and only now, has it been found.
I dont think the exploit will be there for a long this since im releasing the program to the public.
